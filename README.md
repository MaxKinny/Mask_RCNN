## Introduction: 
I want to divide a crane into different parts. 

The parts' division:

Class Names = ['connection', 'claw']

In my case, 'claw' class has 2 instances, 'connection' has 1.
## Step by step label my crane dataset via VIA
To do that, you may think I have to label 2 times to create 2 datasets and train 2 maskRCNN models respectively. Indeed, I have to train 2 models for above 2 kinds of division ways. However, due to the convenience of VIA, I can label these 2 datasets at once.


## Training
1. Train model for first way: 
```c
cd <repo_root_path>/samples/ballon
```
